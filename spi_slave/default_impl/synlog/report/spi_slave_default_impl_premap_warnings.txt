@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\embedded\fpga projects\spi_slave\spi_slave.sv":52:1:52:9|Found inferred clock top|CLK which controls 30 sequential elements including spi.LED. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
